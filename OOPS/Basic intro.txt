	class = data + functions ( encapsulation )

	Data hiding :-

	Making members of the class as private/public
	based on the real world requirement.

	Abstraction :-
	Hide complexity from the object and provide
	simple functions to invoke.

 	namespace = collection of classes.
	namespace n1
	{
		class c1
		{
		.
		}
		class c2
		{
		.
		}
	}
 

	Create a class called "Bank" with private
